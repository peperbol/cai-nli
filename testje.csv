0,TUR,"	Today, we are living in an age of consumption, by consuming various products either because we vitally need them or we are conditioned to do so. As a consequence we are destined to make continuos choices about our consumption and advertisements hold an unavoidable place in the process. The way we determine our choices among, more or less equally qualified, products is connected to the way they are promoted to us to a great extent. 
	There are two ways that the advertisemets take hold of our choices, first, they associate superior qualities to a product, apart from the reality behind. As an example to such a situation, we can look at an experiment made my Coca-Cola experts testing their new formulation of coke, in late 1980s, to reveal the reason behind the steep decrease in the sales. When the experts made people try both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, without indicating their brands, even the Coca-Cola fans were not able to distinguish between the two brands and chose Pepsi, as being Coca-Cola. The main outcome of the experiment was the indication that Coca-Cola fans were overall choosing the brand based upon bombardment of advertisements, instead of a distinct difference in taste.
	The second role of advertisements to promote a product is to associate it with another aspect of life, generally with satisfaction of another need. For example, in most of the advertisements of Gilette, we see a sexy guy, half-naked, shaving himself and being adorned by women. Such advertisements give the message of: shaving with Gilette makes you attractive for women, is an important tool in increasing the sales of the product, by implicitly satisfying a subconscious desire of men.
	Overall, it becomes apperant that, in a world of choices accompanied by numerous products on shelfs, advertisements manipulate our actions. That is why big corporations invest millions of dolars in advertisement, as a sign of huge gains coming from advertisements. At this point, it is our responsibility, to make most keen choices by comparing the quality of a product with its price.

1,ITA,"The idea that young people nowadays do not devote enough time, and thus have become less altrustic towards their communities than before, is a common mistake.

This idea comes from a well known process which leads the formation of several other prejudices (like, for example, the idea that home made products are always better than industrial ones). This phenomenon, which I would call 'the myth of old times', is based on the common perception that younger generations are much more egoist and greedy than older ones. 
It is often thought, especially in ageing societies, like in our wealthy western nations, that younger people intrinsically lack values, and for this reasons do not do enough for their communities.

It is certainly true that there has been an evolution towards societies more based on individuals and it is also true that the time shedule of the people have started to be impressingly filled by many activites. But this does not authomatically lead to the statement that young people are egoists towards thier communities.
First, this increased individualism and time shortage applies to all the age groups in an equal manner, and second, nowadays communities have much less needs which must be satisfied by the commitment of young people. Examples of this type are elderly healthcare, childcare, and a lot o small activities such as taking water from the river, etc etc. Therefore decreased needs mean decreased needs of time to devote.

If one tries to honestly look at the evidence, the data suggests that the commitment towards volounteer organization has grown steadily and strongly among young people in the last decades.
Nowadays, the work of young people for their community, though certainly changed in its organization, looks much more effective (also due to technological progress) and genuinely driven by the will of helping other people than before. 
There are thousands of junior volounteering groups all across United States witnessing this fact.

For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the passage and I believe that nowadays young people devote quite a reasonable amount of time to help their communities.

2,JPN," I agree with the statement as it says, the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. There are three advantages. First, as you traveling in a group led by a tour guide, tour guide will let you know every single thing you need to see in the journey. For example, if you want to go sightseening, a tour guide will escort you to the sight. The tour guide will be resopnsible whatever traveler wants to do. They just don' have to worry about reserving the resturant or doing some speacial activities. Espeacialy when they cannot speak English or German or whatever the languages are spoke in the country where they travel to. Second, since go traveling with group, they will definately get along with each other and have fun. If traveling alone, it won't be able to have much fun as traveling with group. Third, traveling a gourp with a tour guide is much more safer than traveling alone. Of course a tour guide knows about the location where is not safe enough to go so they won't go to the dangerous side of city. 
Ever since transportations developed amagingly, the world gets closer. We can go to the another side of world by airplane in ten hours or it may take a day to get there. It used to take about two, three months to get to the other countires. The world is getting more dangerous, most of people have guns and knife. so traveling with a tour guide is very helpfull to the traveler.
In my experienses, I have gone to Australia by my own. It was still scary to go there by self. Espeacialy in town side. When I went to town, I lost my wallet. i didn't lose my passport, thougt. So ever since I believe traveling with a tour guide is better and safer.

3,TUR,"I do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do. Altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older, thus, may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activities, older people have also some advantges of the old ages provide them.

Young poeple are energetic and active, hence,  often dominate most of the daily life activities we see around. However, when compared to older people, younger ones have more responsibilty, which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life. For example, I and my sister are working in full time jobs,  which make us to spend all day in work. Besides that, we are studying for graduate degrees and this takes most of our free time. However, my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement years, spend their days with shopping, wandering around, travelling and hosting family members in the weekends. 

Another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family members more than the younger ones have been. In my culture, senior people are highly respected. They have been consulted for experiences they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span. That is, they are often visited by familty members, by relatives,which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do. 

One other point is that having developed a mature taste of preferences, older poeple do not spend time trying new things spend their times in a more quality way. Yet, young people generally like trying new things as if they have not developed  permanent life preferences. In other words, young people can be thought as they are still in their life cycle, which can be characterized by flcutuations in tastes and preferences.

 Therefore, I cannot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do. Both age groups have their own advantages and disadvantages. While young people may be healthier and more active than old people, older people can enjoy many different aspects of life. The more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in, one should know how to enjoy life. 


"
4,TUR,"While I was in school I was very unhappy when its time to learn the fact and memorize them because I was having more fun when trying to understand  the ideas and concepts. I still believe on the same way. I think that trying to understand ideas makes you think on it more and you learn easier. In an other way the things you have learned keep in your mind in a longer period of time when you try to understand the idea or concept.

When you just try to memorize the facts and do not pay attentinon to the understand its concept I think its like being a car engineer who never seen a car. A car engineer can know any technical detail about a car's mechanic but if he had never seen a car he would not understand the what it is for and how it is working.  

I had two different history teahers in high school, the one I had in second class was always want us to memorize and learn the facts. The history teacher I had in third class wants us just to understand the ideas, like why the wars begin istead of when did a specific war begin. I still remember the things i had learned in 3rd class but still have nothing in mind from the facts that i had memorised during second class.

As a conclusion, the reason that trying to understant the ideas instead of learing the facts makes you think more and help you to understand more, I think it is more important for me and most of the students to try to understand it. In add'ition the thing you understand stay in your mind longer.
"
5,JPN,"I agree with the opinion. These days, In Japan, Young people (like elementary school's, Junior high school's, etc.) have no time to communicate, to play, to exercise. Because Goverment decided to do, Saturday is rest day. And They said to all scholls in Japan that It must have special class which is called ""social class"". The class have propose to know human's pride, role, and old Japan's young people what to do play. So, as a result five class decreased in a week.
I think it is important, too. Because Japan has a lot of nature, and there is no enough food and things. So young people always play wild ground. They love playing. And they thought a lot of things. For example, like baceball. They like baceball, but they didn't have bat and balls. So they use tree's stick and ball which was made by sand and sox. They put into sand to sox. Other point, they love wild nature. they often go to the forest, river, ocean and etc. And they found new discovery every time.
But These days, there are lots, lots of food and things. So if A person hope something, Parents go to shopping and buy it at once. So they don't use their brain. Other point, Human builded lots of building next to next. So nature decrease more and more. So children can't play outside, so they play play in the house. And their body 

"
6,ITA,"Traffic, a rapid increase in fuel price and its scarcity, pollution and the related environmental threats, the number of accident: they are all elements that probably will lead in the next future to a sharp decrease in the number of cars.
As many people, and in particular the car industry, may think that, on the contrary, cars will continue to be increasingly used, I am confident new solutions will be applied.

It has to be said that the modern public services, with regard to ways of transport offered, have a better quality than the past years. Trains and subways can now considered a reliable way to move from a place to another, with no risk to get there later. Traffic jam, instead, is the first reason for people to be late and to increase their daily stress: this situation is the main reason for people to let their cars parked. 

Using cars is also not convenient, from an economic point of view. Today, fel costs, which increase at a pace rate, has a negative impact on a family income. I can handle my personal experience. My parents, for example, decided to reduce the times they use the car to move, or, at least, they try to combine their different necessities going out together, in order to save fuel.

Moreover, is has been proved that air pollution, due to cars- emissions, is the first cause of breath diseases, even in young people. To contrast the indiscriminate use of cars, many  Italian municipalities, decided to prevent cars from moving in periods when wheather conditions worsen the concentration of dangerous pariculates in the air. And connected to this, somewhere fees to  car entrance in the cities have been introduced. 

For all these reason, I am confident that in the following years, an increasing number of people will be more aware  of the positive outcome in not using cars and, as a consequence, their sale will be lower.  When the number of cars will be reduced, we all feel healthy (as bikes will outspread in our cities with no consequences for the environment), happy with the money saved we would buy thing more useful and confident that it was the right thing to do.





"
7,JPN,"	It is a difficult question, but for me, the choice is clear. I disagree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.	There are two reasons; the prevention of the reallity and the conclution of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers.
	The first reason is the prevention of the reallity. It is based on the situation that customers ordinally make a judge from the advertisement whether they buy it or not.  I think advertisements should be besed on the products. The role of the advertisements is telling customer what the products rally are and what points are distinguish on other products. The advertisements should be neesded the reallity of the products. The second reason is the construction of the reliable relationship between retailers and customers. The advertisement explains about the product, so the custmer can buy it without anxious. 
	Those are my opinions.  Thus, I disagree the following statement.   
"
8,JPN,"     I definetely agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. 
      It is not exaggeration that we now live in cars society. Cars made a revolution of transformation method, they established the position as the most convenient transportation method. Besides, car market is also one of the biggest commercial markets, and cars are essential to our economy. Considering the statement, however, we need to pay attention to the disadvantags of them. 
      Using cars cause the enrvironmental problem; for example,  an air pollution and the earth warming.As the gas which are excluded from each car contaminates the air especially in the city, people are suffering from the uncleared air. To make matters worse, it is reported that it can cause the earth warming, which is the biggest environmental problem not only for the people of city dwellers but also the people in the world. Moreover, in terms of the natural resorces, cars requires a lot of gasoline to mobilize them. Gasoline are made by refining the petrogen, which is said to run out in 25 years in the earth. From the point of the human society, using cars generates a number of traffic accidents due to the careless mistakes or the drive by the drunker. Traffic accidents are the social problem in my country, Japan, and more than 10000 people are killed every year.
        Considering the other transportation method, such as the plane, the train, the bus, there are more advantages than cars have. These public transportation system can carry much more people, and save the fuel and natural resorces. Accordingly, they don't pollute the environment as much as the cars. In terms of safety, they can lose the possibilities of facing the accidents by using these system. The rate of encounting accidents of public system are much lower than the cars. If you can dring a lot or get tired, you can go home by using them.
       As I mentioned above, there are more good points in using public transportation system. Of course, cars provides us the enlightment of driving and some people are fascinated with the speed. But now we need to take care of the disadvantages in terms of the envirnment and safety. I believe people will soon give up using cars, and use public system in stead.


"
9,ITA,"I am agree with this statement because if a student understand ideas and concepts using analizing facts he can reach quickly the learn of the facts. I think these are two different way of compreantion but a student can choose the one he prefer.
There are some people who prefer study from books and impress facts in their memory, other listen the lesson of the professor and understand the ideas and the concept that can help him to reach facts studing just a little bit.
For example if you study history, you can study the facts appened but if you don't  understand the reasons which bring these facts you will find problems to collocated them in the progress of the story. On the contrary understandig the ides or the facts which supports the way adopted, you will be able to reach the fact  easier.
I think that in some case understanding concepts and ideas must be  related with exarcitation and sperimentation. 
For example you can study for a week maths, you can make exercitation but if you don't understand the reson of the operation that you made you don't  will be able to use it in a correct way. Making exercitation students can learn how to proceed in a correct way and making wrong operation they will be able to understand the concepts and don-t make the same errors or mistakes in the future.  
We can associate this process of exarcitation or sperimentation with the study of a foreign language; the most pratically way to learn a language is to go studing in a country where this language is the national one. Listening and talking with people is the easiest way to learn the language.

10,ARA,"     Every one try to look for enjoyment in his/her life. Enjoyment in life is not easy to earned, and it requiers several things. In my own opinion, there are two important requirements to enjoy in your life such as, huge experience, and have your own money. Furthermore, those requirements we can found in older people.So, i disagree that "" young people enjoy life more than older people"".  
     First of all, older people have more experience than young people.Also, if you have alot of experience you will be able to choose the good and more benefit things for you to enjoy. Forexample, traveling bring enjoyments when it is empty from the dangerouse things, and to be away from hazardness, you have to have enogh experience.Experience is really protect you from dangerous thinga and from hazardness.
     Then, older people depend on themselves, and they have their own money. So they will be able to know how, where , and when to use and spend their money. Also, they will be able to save money for their needs,and they will be aware from loans .
     In the conclusion, older people are more awake,and they can earn their right and exact enjoyment in their life. Moreover,  I think  it is really important to advice our children about getting the right  and good enjoyment in our fabulouse life.Enjoyment is diffecult to earned .
"
11,JPN,"   Some people think that  it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide, because they can get more imformation from a tour guide and also they can make some friend through the tour.However I do not agree with this idea for these reasons.
   First of all, I like to prepar the travel schedual by my selfe before the trip such as I would like to go this restaurant, visit this museam, buy this shop, and so on. Without a tour guide I can get a lot of imfomation from Internet befor I go to a trip.
  Second  of all,  I can decide how many time I should spend in the place.If I find the really really good place,I  will decide to spend a lot of time to be there. On the other hand,If I go to a trip in a group led by a tour guide,because it has already dicided how many time I spend where I go,so I shoud leave the place within the time. I can not stand!! I would like to enjoy my trip!So I really think  people who want to spend great time in the trip,they should go a trip which they made schedual themselves. 
   Third of all, it is my challenging time to speak local people where I go to the first place. I like to comunicate with foreing country people. 
If I go to  a country which is spoken English such as the United state,Canada, the UK and so on, I can develop my English through the experiment.On the other hands, If I go to a travel with a tour guide
I think I will depend on him because he always appear beside myself!
   For these reasons,I can not agree with the statement,the best way to travel is in a group 
"
12,ARA,"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects than one specific subject is a wonderful thing to have. It is every man's dream but I totally disagree.

The ability to memorize things is a gift from god, and it differs from one person to another. Only a small percentage of people in the world are capable of memorizing information of multiple academic subjects  with ease,the others who are the majority can't do that easially instead they work harder and read for longer hours trying to compensate for the lack of this ability.In the other hand the majority of people are capable  of  focusing or specializing in one specific subject which is again not an easy task to do but still without doupt much easier than broad knowledge of many subjects.

Broad Knowledg of multiple subjects has many disadvantages,apart from being difficult, chances to forget things, make mistakes  or confuse one thing to another are  very high compared to specific subject knowledge. In the other hand,specific knowledge is easy to maintain,low chances of error and perfection is easy to achieve.

I admit that specific knowledge has some disadvantages too,like being boring sometimes and if you do a mistake you will be badly blamed.

In the end, choosing between the two kinds of knowledge depends on the person's capability and interest. Both are really good and helpful to the world we are living in.But i am sure that I am not capable of general knowledge and i'd rather to sepcialize in one specific subject.

"
13,ARA,"	Althogh, some people think that students need only to learn the facts, I totally to agree with understanding the concept and the ideas. There are many reasons for which students need to understand the basic idea.

	One of the reasons is that the students will only use the concept and the ideas from which they have been taught.  Understanding the concept is more important than the facts in that the concept can be involved in any suitable application. For example, a student in a physics class will propably need to understand the formula before he or she wil be able to solve the problems. 


	Another reason is that when the students learn some facts, it is easy to forget them. This is beacuse they need to be memorized. Also, every information that is stored in the brain can be lost if it is not used repeatedly. Therefore, understanding is much easier than memorizing.

	An Aditional reason is that understanding is more effective in developing new thing than learning facts. To illustrate that, supposed a student in a physics college tried to memorize the content of the course without giving any care to understanding it. The student surely will find a lot of troubles in his life if he or she tries to prove a new theory realtive to the information that have been taught. Hence, If the student understood the courses without memorizing the content, the student will be able comperhend with the life challenges. 

	One final reason is that facts does not provide any thinking. It is either right or wrong. On the other hand, understanding the concept can be duplicated to obtain some other new concepts. For example, the conflict between the relativity and the laws of motions cannot be solved unless both of them are understood. Once the concept is understood, the solution for such a conflict can be solved. Which gave rise into a new concept called "" The String Theory"".

	In conclusion, understanding the ideas is much easier than just memorizing the facts that are concret and non-negotiable.

14,TUR,"   Are you young? you have to know the importace of it. when you are old, you do not some activities and you have a lot of diseases. you have to think  about their children. you have many responsibilities. I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people, because you do not have any worry and you have much energy.
  first of all, when you are young, you should enjoy, due to the fact that you have more energy. young people have more energic than the oldest. for this reason, they can many activities. for example; they can go skiing, they can climbing the moontain. these activities may make the lives of people enjoyable. 
    secondly, young people enjoy life more than older people do, because they have no worries. old people worry about their futures. this may not give a permission them to live happly. what is more; the oldest have fears of dying, because their ages are very high. for these reasons; they enjony life less than yhe youngest.
    to sum up, I agree this issue, because young people do not worry about future and dying and they are energitic. If you are either young or old, you should make an effort to live happly.

15,ARA,"In the past , people was not having any idea about advertisnment , but today advertisment is mostly  provided through media , for example , TV, internet , newspaper , magazines and radio . Advertisment is defined as giving an unknowncemt to the people by motiviting them to buy ,or to use certine product by different attractive means . This essay is going to explain why most advirtisment making the producte seem muh better than they really are .

Some people believe that ,advertsmetn is bad thing since it is giving wrong information about the product ,.Moreover ,it is also make people to buy unnecessary things  . Also , it is making people to waste their money for the thing which is no more good .  




Most of the people thinks that advertisment is useful for saling the product and the maximum amount of product which can give interest to the seller . 
Firstly , if advertisment was not put for certain product , people will never hear about it .Secondly , it orient people about some thing which  they dont know or didn hear about it . Thirdly advertisment , is helping people to get what do they want of certine product . Forthly , it is giving nice veiw for product and make it easy tobe saled .In addisition , 


In summury , advertisments is useful methods for selling goods and helping people getting what do they want .In the future , people should detect new methods of introducing or markting the produt  and sale it not only in one country but all over the world . It is recommanded that , advirtsing through different kind of media is really beneficial for trading ..I believe that , unless produt is good , the markting service will not make it to appear better than they really are.

16,ITA,"If I had to refer only to my personal experience I would have to completely agree with the statement. Fortunately not every youngster is like me.

I must confess that I have never taken part to community service, which in my home country, Italy, young men could choose as an alternative to military service.  A bill has been passed that frees my generation from military service and thus also from ""compulsory"" community service. I might have justfied my behavior by saying that nowadays the sense of community that used to animate the life of suburbia and countryside villages has been lost; that work conditions and habits have changed and all in all people are less and less tied to their own communities. They think and act global.

But the fact that I am selfish does not imply that so are my fellow citizens of the same age.  I have many friends devoted to at least one community service activity. My best female friend has been active in the emergency transport service, that brings patients to emergency rooms and hospitals for the past five years and she is still on duty once a week every thursday night. It is worth to mention that in Italy this service  is run on a voluntary basis.

Finally one can extend what I have mentioned about the fading of local communities and claim that the young should take care of the global communtiy and especially its poorest members. More and more young women and men are now spending their holidays in non governmental organizations active in the poorest part of the world. As far as I am concerned I have never joined these programs, but my sister and some frinds of mine did last year. They were helping in a small hospital in satellite town of Kolkata, India.

So, hopefully, the picture is not so bleak, at least as long as my friends persist in their altruism.

17,ARA,"  According to what all government say, that all cars must only be transported from an country to another with in a five years of date of due from the company. Every country must make a roule about controlling the number of car that is coming year after year.
  Every new car that is made, it brings with it more pollution and more traffic to the world. The government must have a limit or a regulation to prevent the additions of cars year after a year.
I think that in five or ten years they will be more fewer cars then there is now, but i don't think that after twenty years they will be more. because technology will prevent it and they will stop using cars. They will use new technolgy rather then cars that bring us problems like pollution, car accidents, more traffics, death penalties etc...
In the newer world they will find a solution for it, because if not it will be a catastrophe and a disaster. Because logically world is not gonna get bigger in twenty years but cars are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain. I think technology will take place in twenty years from now, it might use plane besides cars or huge escalators through buildings, maybe even escalators underground. No one knows what is in the future or what is waiting for us then. Life is much harder then we think we can't just imagine it with in a few words it much more complicated.
  I hope for the best in our future life for all whom gonna participate in it., and i hope that tecnology will prevent the catastrophy probelm of cars and stop it from growing into the world and multiplying by billions.of countity. Everyone looks for his best and goods. Life is life.
"
18,ITA,"This statement seems like a biblical rivelation, but can be true if we considere only our Europe .
If I see the past, really, I see that in the last thirty years we have had at first a rapid, after more costant, growth of the number of cars in general. Really, the growth of cars can be interpretated by the development of our europen society. Of course, this growth has token with its other problems,  like the pollution , or the growth of the price of oil . So, in europen and american cities, I think that there will be a slow decline of the use of car, caused by new laws against car- use and its pollution, or by the encrease of price of the fuel, or by the oblish ( I hope !!!) of the use of pubblic trasport in the centre of our cities. For this reasons, in Europe, I think that the statement will be true.
Altough, if we see the world, it is sure that the total number of cars will grow: some nations, like China, or India, or Brazil, are becoming modern nation, and people of these areas, will want to have a car like us. In fact, a good part of this people , that is migrating to the city,  will have a better input of money and will be able to take a car. So, this fact will cause new pollution for these countries, and until the governments will not make new laws, it will have a growth.
So, in conclusion,with a global vision. I am disagreed with the statement, and I think that the situation can only become  more negative. We must catch a solution not for cars, but for pollution, and with the reserch to create a car with hydrogen like fuel, we will live better with more cars.
"
19,TUR,"The purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy a specific product. The business world especially marketers thinks that it does not really necessary to tell the truth, if you could sell something. 
First of all, advertisements are one of the most important tools of marketing. Their first and for most purpose is to attract people and persuade them to buy. The goal of advertisements is not to tell the truth. They can tell to truth but it does not mean that  it is not just a way of marketing. It is still  tring to convince people to prefer particular thing to others. 
People usually buy things which they saw  on advertisements, and usually they get disappointed with the result. Even though people think that they are buying the same thing, the reality is that the product is always exegirated in advertisements and it will be worse than people thought. The basic example for this will be hamburgers. When I go to a fast food restaurant, I saw lots of pictures of hamburgers, and they look really big. When I buy one, I always find it to small to saticify, because the pictures convince me that they will be really big. 
However, one of the easiest way of getting information about a product is advertisements. Before buying something people want to learn more about it. They do not want to buy which they really do not need.  People see advertisements in everywhere so they do not have to spend too much effort to obtain an information. 
Altough advertisements are the easiest way to learn something about a product to make a desicion,  people should reconsider every detail that they heared from or saw on an advertisement if it can be true or not. They should be aware of the reality that the ads are for convincing people, not for telling the truth.
